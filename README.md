The goal of this project is to be able to progress early season prototyping in FRC after crayon cadding by making an easy to use tool for making simulated versions of robotsnin unity. Allowing for FRC robots to be conceptualized then put through virtual representations that assume perfect execution of the design.

***Alpha 1 proggress***
- generate drive train (in progress)
- Generate Elevator (Complete)
    - One Script as many stages as you want
    - Set the height of the elevator in inches
    - set the width of the elevator in inches
    - Set the weight of the "stationary" stage
    - set the weight individually of the moving stages
    - Customizable setpoints with ability to choose toggle, hold, sequence
- generate Arm (at alpha 1 goal)
      -single stage only
      -setpoint control same as elevator
      -continuous aim mode for shooting games
- Changeable field (not started)
- Generate hook (not Started)
- Game Piece animation system (not started)
- File Cleanup (in progress)
- Example Robots (not started)
- Early Documentation (not started)

***Missing or future update features***
- metric support (non inch settings)
- non 1x2 tubing mechanisms
- Non Square drive trains
- different swerve module configs and shapes
- Generate Turret
- Basic Motor simulation

***Non targeted features (unlikley/never)***
- Non unity editor support (including any kind of "game")
- Counted scoring for fields
- Robot to game piece physics
- color coded subsystems (unity gets mad due to the editor requirements)
