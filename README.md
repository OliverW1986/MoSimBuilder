The goal of this project is to connect FRC gaming and early season prototyping like crayon cad into one thing. Allowing for robots to be conceptualized then put through virtual representations that assume perfect execution of the design.

***Alpha 1 proggress***
- generate drive train (in progress)
- Generate Elevator (in progress)
- generate Arm (not started)
- Changeable field (not started)
- Game Piece animation system (not started)
- File Cleanup (in progress)
- Example Robots (not started)
- Early Documentation (not started)

***Missing or future update features***
- metric support (non inch settings)
- Non Square drive trains
- different swerve module configs and shapes
- Generate Turret
- Basic Motor simulation

***Non targeted features (unlikley/never)***
- Non unity editor support
- Counted scoring for fields
- Game piece physics
- color coded subsystems (unity gets mad due to the editor requirements)
